            "Cybercrime is expected to cost organisations worldwide over $10 trillion annually by 2025, up from $3 trillion in 2015. That represents an annual growth of 15% â€” one of the greatest transfers of economic wealth ever. There is a huge need for innovative technologies to address the state of the industry. Cyber security data is inherently connected. To obtain a comprehensive picture to determine the severity of a particular threat, information from many different sources needs to be integrated. It's therefore essential that tools exist to make this integration, as well as the analysis of the data, more effective and efficient.",
            "Given the heterogeneous and complex nature of cyber security data, TypeDB is a perfect fit. TypeDB's expressive schema language, which allows for concepts such as type hierarchies and hyper relations, gives you a level of expressivity which can model the most complex cyber security data as accurately as possible. And through that semantic richness, TypeDB makes it easy to discover new insights, improving prevention of cyberattacks and helping to secure your enterprise."

Using TypeDB you can now fully represent this complexity in a database that can take into account all of its context and semantics. TypeDB becomes a necessary tool to not only store this data, but also to reveal implicit knowledge and insights, in order to improve the security of your organisation.",
            "To help you get started with TypeDB, together with the community we have released an open source CTI platform called [TypeDB CTI](https://github.com/typedb-osi/typedb-cti) that you can start using today. Based on the well-known [STIX](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro.html) data standard, it provides a unified approach to the description of different kinds of cyber security data. This makes it straightforward for cyber security analysts to ingest heterogeneous threat intelligence data through a single common language which describes the data they work with.",
            "With the new insights that TypeDB can provide, your company can benefit from the next competitive edge. That's why today TypeDB is used to represent cyber security data for applications such as security information and event management, threat intelligence, endpoint detection and response, and many more.
