This makes it easy to integrate heterogeneous data sources and gain new insights from them. A TypeDB knowledge graph enables you to become a knowledge-driven organisation with actionable insights to make business decisions in full context. From Fortune 500 companies to universities, TypeDB makes it easy for anyone to build knowledge graphs.",
