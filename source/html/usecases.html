                <div class="text-block columns marginBottom">
                    <p class="nonbreakable">Across all sectors and all industries, the dizzying digital pace of the twenty-first century has created a common challenge: managing huge volumes of highly varied, rapidly generated data, and gaining actionable insight from that data. Unfortunately, traditional data tools and technologies are inadequate to this task, keeping critical relationships hidden and deeper meaning undiscovered.</p>
                    <p class="nonbreakable">The Mindmaps platform provides a critical and timely solution to these cross-industry challenges. By giving meaningful structure to data, and giving developers the flexibility and choice they require, Mindmaps can help you address your complex data needs and rapidly speed up development times for mission-critical applications. Some of the industries where Mindmaps is best suited are explained below.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Pharmaceuticals</h3>
                <div class="text-block columns">
                    <p>Pharmaceutical research and development is an incredibly competitive, costly, time intensive, and informationally complex process. During the many stages of R&Dâ€”from initial conception and pre-clinical testing through to clinical testing and regulatory approvalâ€”firms must manage complex data workflows. These huge volumes of varied data are all too often siloed in traditional storage formats, both across departments within a pharmaceutical firm and, increasingly, outside the firm, in complicated networks of partners and contract research affiliates.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, current data representation and management technologies are inadequate to optimally address the complex relationships that characterize pharmaceutical R&D. Without meaningfully interconnected data, workflows are disrupted, significant patterns and relationships may go unnoticed, and decision making can be significantly delayed. Given the high costs of development and the associated high stakes for approval, mismanagement and missed opportunities can have serious business consequences.</p>
                    <p>By harnessing the power of Mindmaps you can give meaningful, machine-readable structure to your data, allowing you to identify and manage complex relationships, draw inferences and reason automatically, make intelligent and dynamic queries, explore and visualize your data in an integrated way, and perform high-level analytics. Mindmaps can leverage your information assets, giving you the strategic insight necessary for effective decision making and helping you remain competitive in the contemporary drug discovery market.</p>

                <h3>Healthcareâ€¨</h3>
                <div class="text-block columns">
                    <p>To deliver timely, effective, and cost-managed care, healthcare practitioners and administrators at all points of patient contact rely on large volumes of heterogeneous data. From patient electronic health records and billing information, to medical device, clinical research, and operational data, optimally utilizing all of this data is essential in contemporary healthcare settings to ensure high quality, accountable care. The appropriate and sophisticated use of genetic biomarkers, and other advances in translational medical research, is especially important.</p>
                    <p>Yet, when data remain disconnected, lacking meaningful structure and not subject to integrated analysis, communication between different stakeholders is compromised, impacting the delivery of individual patient care. Moreover, beyond individual patients, population health management requires intelligent data aggregation, integration, management, and analysis, in order to gain holistic insight into best practice prevention, diagnosis, and treatment protocols. Unfortunately, current data technologies do not adequately meet these critical healthcare industry needs. The costs of data misuse and mismanagement, for both clinical and business outcomes, is exceedingly high.</p>
                    <p>Using the Mindmaps platform, data can be managed and insight acquired that will benefit frontline clinical workers, medical researchers, and healthcare administrators. By representing and connecting data in a sophisticated, meaningful manner, the true power of a healthcare system can be realized, lowering costs while addressing gaps in care and facilitating optimal health outcomes. Relationships between formerly implicit clinical data points can be rendered explicit, intelligent and natural queries an be made, complex relationships can be uncovered and automatically reasoned over, and data can be explored and visualized in an integrative manner.</p>

                <h3>Insurance</h3>
                <div class="text-block columns">
                    <p>The entire insurance industry revolves around data. From developing new products and identifying suitable customers, to pricing premiums appropriately and managing claims and payouts, insurance companies must take advantage of all available data to make savvy business decisions and maintain customer relationships.</p>
                    <p>Yet, while huge volumes of customer transactional and internal operational data are being collected, traditional database technologies are inadequate for gaining sophisticated insight into individual customers, nor can they powerfully uncover aggregate demographic and business patterns. The obstacle of dynamically reviewing claims, making suitable payouts, and identifying inconsistencies as, for example, regulations shift and therapeutic protocols evolve, is far from trivial.  At the same time, deliberately fraudulent claims remain a huge obstacle to the industryâ€™s bottom line, and such claims are difficult to identify without sophisticated analytics, especially when data remains scattered across different internal departments, lacking functional unity.</p>
                    <p>By using Mindmaps, insurance companies can leverage their informational assets into real insight. By integrating data and giving it meaningful structure, queries can be made that are both complex and natural, relationships that exist implicitly within the data set can be made explicit, data can be explored and visualized in a unified manner, and automated reasoning and high-level analytics can be performed. These technical capabilities can be used to develop and sell insurance products that meet the current and future needs of their customers, while managing risk adequately, improving the efficiency of claims review, and enhancing profitability.</p>

                <h3>Legal</h3>
                <div class="text-block columns">
                    <p>At all stages of preparation for cases, legal practitioners rely constantly on data. At the same time, there is ever more legal data being digitized and made accessible through legal publishers and government agencies, but it is rarely easy to comprehensively identify the relevant linkages between what is available and the known data for the case at hand. Despite many technological advances, the legal profession is far from harnessing the true power of data.</p>
                    <p>With increasing case complexity, the demands on individual lawyers and on teams of lawyers therefore grows. It becomes increasingly difficult to actively keep track and be aware of all the different components of a case and understand how they integrate together and relate to similar cases across juridistictional contexts. Unfortunately, existing database technologies are quite ill-suited to the effective management and analysis of the complex relationships that exist within complex legal dataâ€”and, consequently, a reliance on such technology limits insight and the efficient preparation of cases.</p>
                    <p>By using the Mindmaps platform, legal data can have a much more meaningful, integrated structure, allowing implicit relationships to become explicit. This enables legal practitioners to identify the most relevant features and patterns of a case, making complex queries with natural language, automatically reasoning over data, visualizing data and relationships with ease, and engaging in high-level analysis as needed. This allows for a streamlined legal workflow that not only improves insight into legal complexity, but also allows lawyers to work effectively and efficiently together.</p>

                <h3>Retail</h3>
                <div class="text-block columns">
                    <p>Retailers are collecting and managing increasingly large volumes of customer data, across multiple channels of interaction, both online and offline. From straightforward transactional information characterizing purchase behaviour, including location data, to external social media and demographic data, there is a wealth of insight to be had about product purchase distribution and trends, consumer preferences, loyalty, and engagement, if analysis is sufficiently sophisticated.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, due to limitations in existing relational storage formats, retailers are all too frequently storing data without much analysis, failing to harness its real power. This lack of analysis limits the business strategy of departments as varied as marketing, customer service, and supply chain management. Effectively managing and integrating this wealth of customer data across its many streams and identifying relevant connections between data points is essential to remain competitive in the contemporary retail space.</p>

                <h3>Financial Services</h3>
                <div class="text-block columns">
                    <p>Data forms the backbone of the modern financial industry. Not only is its intelligent use crucial to making savvy investment decisions and mitigating risk, it can provide deeper insight into customers, facilitating business growth. It also is necessary for the identification of suspicious behavior, from first and third party deposit fraud, to suspicious trading patterns. All the while, as systemic risk reduction policies take hold across the industry, the management of financial data increasingly must comply with complex, constantly evolving regulations.</p>
                    <p>Traditional database technologies and analytic techniques unfortunately lack agility and flexibility, and keep important interconnections between data, across the many departments of a financial institution, hidden. This hinders insight for new opportunities at best, and can lead to poorly analyzed and risky decisions, with potentially drastic consequences.</p>
                    <p>By using the Mindmaps platform, financial industry professionals can acquire the insight from their data necessary to remain competitive. By imbuing data with rich semantics, and integrating it in a powerfully interconnected structure, analysts can make powerful queries, automatically reason over data, and identify implicit relationships and important patterns among disparate data points and make them explicit. Portfolio managers, meanwhile, can holistically explore data, visualize, and analyze it, allowing them to comprehensively manage financial and operational knowledge, finding the best opportunities, and enhancing returns.</p>
