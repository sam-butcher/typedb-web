{"jobs":[{"id":254482,"title":"Database Theory R&D Engineer","description":"Intelligent systems consume data that are too complex for current databases to handle. GRAKN.AI is a database for complex and intelligent systems, that uses a knowledge representation system to structure complex data and reasoning engine to infer and interpret complex relationships.\n**\nWe're a team of 16 talented engineers from Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial, Stanford and other world-class universities, and we're based in London. We've developed a database in the form of a distributed knowledge base that reasons over data in real-time, called GRAKN.AI. it enables machines to handle complex data and derive knowledge that is too complex for human cognition to uncover. Five years from now, GRAKN.AI will be in the hands of every developer as a de facto database for building cognitive and intelligent systems. We're a team with big ambitions, and our competitions are fierce: MongoDB, MySQL, Oracle, Neo4j, and so on. However, none of the current database solutions address the problem of data complexity like we do. And recently, the Cambridge Computer Lab Ring awarded GRAKN.AI as the Product of the Year 2017 .\n**\nSince we released our open source beta late last year, we've passed 3700 user downloads, and our developer community has grown past 220 members. We are now starting our enterprise adoption, and we are entering a massive scaling phase. We are looking for a talented Database Theory researcher/engineer to lead and execute the research and development of Grakn's database design and formal model while the technology continues to scale up.\n**\nReponsibilities: \n1. Ensure that Grakn's database design and formal model is always complete and consistent across all components of the system.\n2. Improving the design of Grakn's Knowledge Representation system to ensure that it remains to be the state of the art in knowlede base technologies. This responsibility will include publishing papers and attending conferences. \n3. Technical writing about our technology for external and internal audience. \n4. Rapid prototyping of the technology.\n*\nRequired Skills: \n1. PhD from a globally recognised university in a field related to Database Theory and Database Management Systems.\n2. Publications in globally recognised academic journals/conferences. \n3. Prototype development for the demonstration of research findings. \n4. Algorithmic coding skills - able to solve complex mathematical and computational coding problems. \n5. Communication skills - able to convey complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.\n*\nBonus skills: \n1. Experience in the field of Knowledge Representation and Automated Reasoning.\n2. Commercial R&D experience. \n3. Worked in SDLC frameworks (ideally Agile). \n4. Java OOP development. \n5. Systems architecture design.","created_at":"2017-07-02T20:08:33.000Z","updated_at":"2017-07-02T20:49:09.000Z","equity_cliff":"1.0","equity_min":"0.1","equity_max":"1.0","equity_vest":"3.0","currency_code":"USD","job_type":"full-time","salary_min":35000,"salary_max":70000,"tags":[{"id":17473,"tag_type":"SkillTag","name":"databases","display_name":"Databases","angellist_url":"https://angel.co/databases-1"},{"id":22505,"tag_type":"SkillTag","name":"research and development","display_name":"Research and Development","angellist_url":"https://angel.co/research-and-development"},{"id":32813,"tag_type":"SkillTag","name":"database and systems design","display_name":"Database and Systems Design","angellist_url":"https://angel.co/database-and-systems-design"},{"id":37994,"tag_type":"SkillTag","name":"research","display_name":"Research","angellist_url":"https://angel.co/research"},{"id":41114,"tag_type":"SkillTag","name":"graph database","display_name":"Graph Database","angellist_url":"https://angel.co/graph-database"},{"id":75915,"tag_type":"SkillTag","name":"relational databases","display_name":"Relational Databases","angellist_url":"https://angel.co/relational-databases"},{"id":96313,"tag_type":"SkillTag","name":"database management","display_name":"Database Management","angellist_url":"https://angel.co/database-management"},{"id":1695,"tag_type":"LocationTag","name":"london","display_name":"London","angellist_url":"https://angel.co/london"},{"id":14726,"tag_type":"RoleTag","name":"developer","display_name":"Developer","angellist_url":"https://angel.co/developer"}],"remote_ok":false,"angellist_url":"https://angel.co/graknlabs/jobs/254482-database-theory-r-d-engineer","startup":{"id":759888,"hidden":false,"community_profile":false,"name":"GRAKN.AI","angellist_url":"https://angel.co/graknlabs","logo_url":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/759888-425d2ecbee554024744b78046d98eef1-medium_jpg.jpg?buster=1492397313","thumb_url":"https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/759888-425d2ecbee554024744b78046d98eef1-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1492397313","quality":5,"product_desc":"GRAKN.AI is the database for intelligent systems.
