<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>

<p>One of the most important features of a Mindmaps graph is that it formalizes a
structure on top of a graph data base. Mindmaps itself is not a graph database
but merely operates on one.</p>

<p>For the moment mindmaps supports <a href="http://tinkerpop.incubator.apache.org/">Tinkerpop
3</a> compliant vendors. Mindmaps Graph
Factory houses methods which can instantiate different Mindmaps Graphs on top
of different Tinkerpop 3 vendors. For the moment this list includes
<a href="http://titan.thinkaurelius.com/">TitanDB</a> and
<a href="http://tinkerpop.apache.org/javadocs/3.1.2-SNAPSHOT/full/org/apache/tinkerpop/gremlin/tinkergraph/structure/TinkerGraph.html">TinkerGraph</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>Feeling Curious?</strong></p>

  <p>As a member of EAP you can attempt to integrate Mindmaps with other Tinkerpop
3 vendors which we have not yet formally supported through these factory
methods. This is a simple matter of:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">java
Graph graph = someTinkerPop3Vendor();
mindmapsGraph = new MindmapsGraphImpl(graph);
</code></p>
