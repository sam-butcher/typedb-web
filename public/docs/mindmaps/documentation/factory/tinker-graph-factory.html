<blockquote>
  <p>Tinkergraph is n in-memory data structure only, so this backed serves as a
good toy to familiarise yourself with the API.</p>

<p>Initialising a Mindmaps graph on top of a TinkerGraph is as simple as:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">MindmapsGraphFactory</span> <span class="n">mindmapsGraphFactory</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">MindmapsTinkerGraphFactory</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getInstance</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">mindmapsGraph</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mindmapsGraphFactory</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">newGraph</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>A Tinkergraph requires no configuration files and does not support
transactions. So this is the simplest way to initialise a Mindmaps Graph.</p>
