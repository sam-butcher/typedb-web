<h1 id="how-does-mindmaps-work">How does Mindmaps work?</h1>

<p>There are four simple steps in using Mindmaps Knowledge Graph, which you
perform intuitively through Graql as the language.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Model Your Knowledge Ontology</p>

    <p>Writing an ontology for a knowledge graph is analogous to defining a
 schema for a relational database, except that an ontology has much higher
 expressivity. An ontology  describes a domainâ€™s terminology and how the
 concepts within the domain relate to each other. The ontology governs the
 correctness of the complex structure of your data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Define Business Rules (optional)</p>

    <p>A business rule defines constraints or inference rules, based on facts
 that govern the operation of a business. For example, regulatory
 compliance rules, medical diagnosis rules, or recommendation rules.
 Business rules enable the knowledge graph to discover violations within
 data, hidden patterns from complex relationships, and implicit knowledge
 where information is missing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Populate Data</p>

    <p>Mindmaps allows high throughput data writes using Graql through multiple
 options of intuitive programming interfaces. Mindmaps also aids the
 knowledge acquisition process where data is acquired from multiple
 sources.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ask Graql Queries</p>

    <p>Querying a knowledge graph using Graql is analogous to querying a
 relational database using SQL, through programming APIs and native syntax,
 except that Graql is more expressive.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
