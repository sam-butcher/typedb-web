# Overview

Graql allows you to query a Mindmaps graph in a declarative, pattern-matching
fashion.

You can execute Graql in the [Graql Shell](graql-shell.md) or using [Java
Graql](java-graql.md).

## Query types

There are four types of queries, which are begun with the follow keywords:
- [match](match-queries.md) - for matching patterns in the graph
- [ask](ask-queries.md) - for querying if certain patterns exist in the graph
- [insert](insert-queries.md) - for inserting types and instances
- [delete](delete-queries.md) - for deleting types and instances
