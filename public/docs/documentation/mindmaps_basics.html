<h2 id="ontology-vs-data">Ontology Vs Data</h2>

<p>A Mindmaps graph is made of two layers. The ontology and the data layer.</p>

<p>The ontology is used to formalise the data within a specific domain. If our
data is about healthcare then we need to design an ontology specific to
healthcare. If our data is about movies, then we need to define an ontology
specific to the movie industry. A Mindmaps ontology is analogous to a database
schema. Ideally, It should be clearly defined before loading data into the
graph. Example of Ontological concepts could include <code class="highlighter-rouge">Car</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Movie</code>.</p>

<p>The data layer is categorised within the ontology. It is essentially everything
we wish to model. Examples of data concept could include <code class="highlighter-rouge">a VW Golf TDI</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Al
Pacino</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Godfather</code>.</p>

<h2 id="the-graph-structure">The Graph Structure</h2>

<p>A graph is defined by vertices and the edges between them. Similarly, a
Mindmaps graph is defined by concepts and the relationships between those
concepts. In the following section we will describe the ways in which concepts
can relate to one another.</p>

<h3 id="concepts-have-types">Concepts Have Types</h3>

<p>All concepts must have a type. The type defines the category which a concept
falls within. It allows us to categorise Instances withi Types  For example the
type of an Instance, <code class="highlighter-rouge">a BMW</code> could be a Type, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Car</code>. Similarly, the type of
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Aristotle</code> is the Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Man</code>.</p>

<p>The following is an example of how Instances can have a Type:</p>

<p><img src="/docs/images/example_types.png" alt="An example of the type relationship between some Instances  and a
Type" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a Mindmaps graph we use the shorthand <code class="highlighter-rouge">isa</code> when representing the type
relationship. For example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Aristotle</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">is a</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Man</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="types-can-be-subclassed">Types Can Be Subclassed</h3>

<p>Mindmaps provides the ability to define rich semantic ontologies. One way of
achieving this is to allow Types to be subclassed. For example, valid
subclasses for the Type, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Vehicle</code> could include <code class="highlighter-rouge">Car</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Truck</code>, and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Motorbike</code>.</p>

<p>If we expand our example above to include female philosophers we would have the
following graph:</p>

<p><img src="/docs/images/example_no_super.png" alt="Expanding the previous example to include female
philosophers." /></p>

<p>By using subclassing we can more richly model this graph as follows:</p>

<p><img src="/docs/images/example_super.png" alt="Expanding the example further to include
subtypes." /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a Mindmaps graph we use the shorthand <code class="highlighter-rouge">ako</code> when referring to a Type being
the sub type of another Type. For example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Man</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">a kind of (ako)</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This simple subclassing allows us to expand and deepen our ontology to whatever
granularity of detail is needed. For example a simple ontology would be <code class="highlighter-rouge">Car</code>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">is a</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Vehicle</code> but with subclassing we could go as far as <code class="highlighter-rouge">a VW Gold TDI
2014</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">isa</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">VW</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">ako</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Car</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">isa</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Vehicle</code>.</p>

<h3 id="types-constrain-roles-that-can-be-played">Types Constrain Roles that can be Played</h3>

<p>A Role allows us to define how concepts can relate to one another for example.
The instance <code class="highlighter-rouge">Al Pacino</code> could have the Role <code class="highlighter-rouge">Actor</code> when relating to to the
movie <code class="highlighter-rouge">Godfather</code>. However, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Al Pacino</code> would have the Role of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Father</code> when
relating to his daughter <code class="highlighter-rouge">Olivia Pacino</code>.</p>

<p>Types allow us to constrain the types of roles Instances can play. This allows
us to ensure that only instances of the correct type are involved in the
correct relationships. For example, in the movie domain, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> Type can
play the role <code class="highlighter-rouge">Actor</code>. This would mean that Instances of the Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code>,
such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">Al Pacino</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">Leonardo DiCaprio</code> are allowed to be <code class="highlighter-rouge">Actors</code> in the
relationship involving the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Actor</code> role. At the same time this would implicitly
define that an Instance of Concept Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dog</code> would not be allowed to play the
role <code class="highlighter-rouge">Actor</code>.</p>

<p>Going back to our philosophers example we could define the following structure
where people can now play the roles of teachers and students:</p>

<p><img src="/docs/images/example_playsrole.png" alt="A simple example of allowing a Type to play specific Role
Types." /></p>

<h3 id="relation-types-are-associated-with-roles">Relation Types are Associated with Roles</h3>

<p>A Mindmaps graph enables us to model complex n-ary relationships. To do this we
define a Relation Type and link it with roles which flesh out the details of
the relationship. For example, in the movie domain a valid Relation Type could
be <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cast</code> which has the Role Types <code class="highlighter-rouge">Actor</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Movie With Cast</code>.</p>

<p>Expanding our philosophers example we could define a Relation Type, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Education</code>
which encapsulates the needed roles:</p>

<p><img src="/docs/images/example_relationtype.png" alt="Expanding the example to illustrate how a relation type is linked with Role
Types." /></p>

<h3 id="defining-relations">Defining Relations</h3>

<p>Relations allow us to represent different instances of Relation Types. For
example one Relation could represent <code class="highlighter-rouge">Al Pacino</code> as an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Actor</code> in the movie
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Godfather</code>, while another Relation could represent <code class="highlighter-rouge">Al Pacino</code> as an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Actor</code>
in the movie <code class="highlighter-rouge">S1m0ne</code>.</p>

<p>Essentially they encapsulate a relationship of a specific type between
instances of a specific type. For example, one Relation can define that the
Instance <code class="highlighter-rouge">Al Pacino</code> plays the Role Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Actor</code> with the movie Instance
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Godfather</code> which plays the Role Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Movie With Cast</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, we can expand our philosophers example to define that Plato taught
Aristotle:</p>

<p><img src="/docs/images/example_relation.png" alt="An example of a Relation. The dark blue represents the Relation which is an
instance of
`Education`" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When creating a relation you must ensure that the type of the Instances are
allowed to play the Role Types. For example, in the above graph if we forgot
to define that the Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> is allowed to play the Role <code class="highlighter-rouge">Teacher</code> then
the Relation between <code class="highlighter-rouge">Plato</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Aristotle</code> would not be valid.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-object-model">The Object Model</h2>

<p>One of the benefits of using the Mindmaps stack is the ability of Mindmaps to
provide a formal structure to a graph database. This section focuses on
understanding that structure. You will be using this object model as a Mindmaps
developer.</p>

<p>The following figure represents the inheritance structure of the Mindmaps
object model:</p>

<p><img src="/docs/images/object_model.png" alt="The Mindmaps Object
Model." /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Types (The right branch in the above diagram) are ontological elements. They
are used to design our domain specific ontology. For example, within the
domain of movies valid types include: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Movie</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Actor</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Director</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Instances (The left branch in the above diagram) are data elements. They are
named such because they are instances of Types. For example, within the
domain of movies, valid instances could include: <code class="highlighter-rouge">The Godfather</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Al
Pacino</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Coppola</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="concepts">Concepts</h3>

<p>A concept represents a thing, for example, a movie, a category etc . .  In the
Mindmaps stack every vertex is a concept. Each concept has the following
properties:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A concept must at minimum have a unique ID. All other properties are
optional.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="unique-properties">Unique Properties</h4>

<p>Properties which must be unique throughout the entire graph.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Id</strong> - A unique string which identifies the concept. For example if a
concept is representing a person it could be their id number.</li>
  <li><strong>Subject</strong> - An optional unique string which can be used to refer to
external resources relating to the concept. For example if the concept is used
to represent a country or city the subject could point to the wikipedia page of
that city.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="additional-properties">Additional Properties</h4>

<p>Properties which store additional information about the concept and do not have
to be unique across the graph.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Value</strong> - A string value which can be used to store an additional piece of
data. For example this could represent a person’s name, a movie title, or any
representative string.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="types">Types</h3>

<p>A Type is an ontological element represents something which can have instances.
To provider a richer ontology Instances can fall into one of the following
Types: Entity Types, Relation Types, Role Types, and Resource Types.</p>

<p>Types can have an additional property, Abstract, which indicates the type
cannot have instances. This is useful when we want to define a deeper ontology.
For example if we have two ontology elements <code class="highlighter-rouge">Car</code> which is a subclass
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Vehicle</code> then we may want to define <code class="highlighter-rouge">Vehicle</code> as abstract to prohibit it have
any direct instances.</p>

<h3 id="entity-types">Entity Types</h3>

<p>A Entity Type is used to represent a category of entities. “Vehicle”, “Movie”,
“Country”. These are valid examples of what a Entity type can be used to
represent.</p>

<h3 id="resource-types">Resource Types</h3>

<p>A Resource Type is used to represent a category of resources. A valid example
could include a <code class="highlighter-rouge">birthdate</code> or a <code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code>. Resource Types have additional
properties including:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Data Type</strong> - Indicates the data type of the resource. For example if the
resource is <code class="highlighter-rouge">Age</code> the the data type would be <strong>integer</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Regex</strong> - Used to constrain string data types to specific regex patterns.</li>
  <li><strong>Unique</strong> - A boolean which indicates if the resource should be unique
across the graph.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="relation-types">Relation Types</h3>

<p>A Mindmaps graph not only models the data but also models the relationships
between the data. These relationships are categorised using Relation Types.</p>

<p>For example, to model that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Al Pacino</code> was an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Actor</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Godfather</code> we would
need an instance of the Relation Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Has Cast</code>. This allows us to model that
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Godfather</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Has Cast</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Al Pacino</code>.</p>

<h3 id="role-types">Role Types</h3>

<p>A Role Type is used to represent a role in a relationship that a concept can
play. For example, if we wish to model that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Al Pacino</code> was in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Godfather</code> then
we define a Role Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Actor</code> which <code class="highlighter-rouge">Al Pacino</code> can play.</p>

<h3 id="instances">Instances</h3>

<p>An instance represents a concept which falls under a type. For example: <code class="highlighter-rouge">a BMW</code>
would be an instance of the Entity Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Car</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">09/10/1988</code> could be an
instance of Resource Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Date</code>.</p>

<h3 id="entities">Entities</h3>

<p>An Instance of an Entity Type (i.e. an Entity)  represents an actual item or
piece of data which falls under a category. For example, the Entity Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Car</code>
could have entities <code class="highlighter-rouge">a BMW</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">this Mercedes</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">that Volkswagen</code>. One of the
most important features of a Mindmaps graph is that it enables us to model
relationships between these entities, once they have been defined.</p>

<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>

<p>Resources are instances of Resource Types and they allow us to attribute data
to a specific instance. For example, if <code class="highlighter-rouge">Alice</code> is an instance of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Person</code> we
could model Alice’s birthday <code class="highlighter-rouge">09/10/1988</code> as an instance of the Resource Type
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Birthdate</code>.  The resource object allows us to impose some additional
constraints on the resource, such as ensuring the resource conforms to a regex
pattern or is of a particular data type.</p>

<h3 id="relations">Relations</h3>

<p>A relation represents an instance of a Relation Type. They allow us to model
multiple relationships between instances. For example, if instances <code class="highlighter-rouge">Alice</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Bob</code> are married then we would create an instance of Relation Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Marriage</code>
to model that relationship. At the same time, Alice could work for an
organisation Apache. Similarly, we would create an instance of the Relation
Type Works For to model that relationship.</p>

<h2 id="the-meta-ontology">The Meta Ontology</h2>

<p>The backbone of any Mindmaps graph is the domain specific ontology which you
design. The domain specific ontology also has its own meta ontoloty. The meta
ontology is a set of concepts which layout the overall structure of a Mindmaps
graph.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just as all roads lead to Rome, all edges lead to the meta ontology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lets see how the meta ontology fits in with a philosophers example:

Mindmaps Meta
ontology." /></p>
